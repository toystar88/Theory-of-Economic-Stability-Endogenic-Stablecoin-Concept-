# Theory of Economic Stability: MVPQ Three-Governor Model

## Overview
This repository presents the **MVPQ endogenic monetary framework**, a constitutional design for zero‑drift stability.  
The system is governed by three autonomous governors:

- **Price (P)** – absorbs surpluses or mints to the FAC buffer  
- **Capacity (Q)** – repairs or expands productive output  
- **Velocity (V)** – manages circulation through demurrage, surcharges, and injections  

Together, these governors hold **P ≈ 1.00** across >99% of real‑world shocks, proving that inflation or deflation is never required for adaptation.

## Key Features
- **Endogenic Stability**: Peg maintained internally through rule‑based governor cascades.  
- **FAC Buffer**: All surpluses/deficits flow through Feedback Allocation Capacity, never directly to wallets.  
- **Transparent Dashboards**: Public reporting of flows, actions, and milestones.  
- **Stress-Tested**: Scenarios include recession, speculative bubbles, pandemics, cyberattacks, and resource shocks.  
- **Governance-Ready**: Decision rules cascade Price → Capacity → Velocity for reproducible clarity.

## Why This Matters
- **Zero‑Drift is Robust**: Over 99% of shocks resolved without inflation/deflation.  
- **Drift Never Helps**: It reallocates suffering, worsens inequality, and delays adaptation.  
- **Boundary Defined**: When Q → 0 (civilization collapse), economics pauses until production/logistics return.  
- **Resilience Embedded**: FAC funds adaptation projects automatically, ensuring continuity.

## Final Note
This repository encodes a constitutional law of money:  
- **Hold P = 1.00** when Q is repairable.  
- **Pause economics** when Q → 0.  
- **Transparency and equity** are the guardrails of resilience.  

MVPQ + FAC + GDI = Humanity’s **monetary immune system**.
